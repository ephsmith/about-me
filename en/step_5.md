## ASCII art

Let’s print something much more fun than text… ASCII art! ASCII art (pronounced '_ask-e_') is creating __pictures out of text__.



+ Let's add some art to your program - a picture of a dog!

+ If you click 'run', you'll see that there's a bug in your new code.

    That's because your text contains a quote, which Python thinks means the end of the text!

+ To fix this, just put a backslash `\` before the quote in the word `here's`. This tells Python that the quote is part of the text.

+ If you prefer, you can use 3 quotes `'''` instead of 1, which allows you to print multiple lines of text with 1 `print` statement:
